# TheSweetShop
I created a sweet shop that would take all of the items that are stored in a company database, display them on the website, with the item name, details and also having a set quantity. customers could create their own account and add items to their baskets, they could also checkout, where once complete they were sent an email saying their order was complete, listing the items the bought.
